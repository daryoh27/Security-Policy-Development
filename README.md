## Overview
This repository is a Security Policy development that focuses on the development, customization, and implementation of cybersecurity security policies designed to enhance organizational resilience, compliance, and data protection.

Security policies form the foundation of a strong cybersecurity framework — defining how an organization protects information assets, manages user behavior, enforces access control, and responds to incidents.
This project utilizes industry best practices and policy templates sourced from the SANS Institute, a globally recognized authority in cybersecurity training and standards.

## Objectives

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Provide a structured set of security policy templates adaptable for small, medium, and enterprise-level organizations.
- Align policies with key cybersecurity frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls.
- Encourage awareness of policy-driven cybersecurity culture.

## Policy Categories Included

The repository includes (or references) the following policy examples:
- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
- Password & Authentication Policy
- Privacy Management Policy

Each policy includes:
- Purpose & Scope
- Policy Statement/Sanctions
- Roles & Responsibilities
- Enforcement & Review Guidelines

## Reference
Policy structure and inspiration were derived from the SANS Institute Security Policy Project, available at:

SANS provides free downloadable policy templates covering multiple domains of cybersecurity — a highly recommended resource for security professionals, auditors, and compliance officers developing baseline security documentation.

## Implementation Guide

To use or adapt these policies within your organization:
- Download the relevant templates from SANS.org or clone this repository.
- Customize each policy to match your organization’s structure, technology stack, and risk appetite.
- Review the policy with legal, compliance, and HR departments.
- Distribute approved policies through official communication channels.
- Train employees on the expectations and security behaviors outlined.
- Review annually or after major organizational/technological changes.

## Tools & Framework Alignment
